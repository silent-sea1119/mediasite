- HTTP Strict Transport Security
  - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains

  - Start with a smaller max-age to start out with
- TLS False Start
- TLS Session Resumption

  - canonical url on the page that is https://mediasite

- App Manifest - manifest.json
  - Don't forget appropriate <meta> tags for iOS/Safari and such
- Don't make a "Thanks for installing me" push notification
  - Pointless; you'll have plenty of chances to engage with the user

- Ask permission in context
- Be awesome!
- g.co/WebPushNotifications

- Use a /shell handler that loads app shell?
